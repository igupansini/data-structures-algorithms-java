### linked list
A linked list is a linear data structure made up of nodes, where each node stores a value and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, elements are not stored in sequential memory locations.

#### Main characteristics:

- Insertions and deletions are efficient, as you only need to adjust pointers.
- No direct access by index (unlike arrays).

A linked list allows dynamic growth or reduction, making it useful for scenarios where the collection size changes frequently.
